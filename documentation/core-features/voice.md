# Voice Interaction System

OPSIIE's voice system provides comprehensive voice input/output capabilities using ElevenLabs for synthesis and Google Speech Recognition for input.

## üé§ Overview

Voice capabilities include:
- **Full Voice Mode**: Both speak and listen
- **Voice Output Only**: OPSIIE speaks, you type
- **Voice Input Only**: You speak, OPSIIE types
- **Multi-Agent Voices**: Different voices for Nyx, G1, and OPSIIE
- **Voice Commands**: Natural language command detection
- **Live Voice Conversations**: Real-time voice chat with AI agents

## üîß Voice Modes

### /voice - Full Voice Mode
**Both speak and listen**

```bash
/voice
```

**Features:**
- OPSIIE speaks responses using ElevenLabs
- You speak commands/queries
- Natural conversation flow
- 20-second inactivity timeout
- Automatic voice command detection

**How to Use:**
1. Type `/voice` or say "voice"
2. Wait for activation confirmation
3. Speak naturally
4. OPSIIE responds with voice
5. Continue conversation
6. Say "voice off" or "exit voice mode" to deactivate

**Example Session:**
```
You: /voice
OPSIIE: "Verbal communication protocol established."

You: [speak] "What's the weather like?"
OPSIIE: [speaks response]

You: [speak] "voice off"
OPSIIE: "Verbal communication protocol bridge collapsed successfully."
```

### /voice1 - OPSIIE Speaks, You Type
**Output-only voice mode**

```bash
/voice1
```

**Use Cases:**
- Want to hear responses
- Prefer typing for accuracy
- Noisy environment
- Hands-free response consumption

**Example:**
```
You: /voice1
OPSIIE: [speaks] "Voice output mode activated."

You: [type] Tell me about quantum computing
OPSIIE: [speaks response]

You: /voiceoff
```

### /voice2 - You Speak, OPSIIE Types
**Input-only voice mode**

```bash
/voice2
```

**Use Cases:**
- Hands-free input
- Faster than typing
- Accessibility
- Quiet environment for reading

**Example:**
```
You: /voice2
OPSIIE: Voice input mode activated.

You: [speak] "Explain neural networks"
OPSIIE: [types response]

You: /voiceoff
```

### /voiceoff - Disable Voice Mode
**Deactivate all voice features**

```bash
/voiceoff
```

Or voice command:
```
"voice off"
"exit voice mode"
```

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Commands

### Natural Language Detection
Voice mode automatically detects command intent from natural speech:

**Memory Commands:**
```
"recall my last project"           ‚Üí /recall last project
"memorize this is important"       ‚Üí /memorize this is important
```

**System Commands:**
```
"status"                           ‚Üí /status
"help"                             ‚Üí /help
"theme"                            ‚Üí /theme (opens theme selector)
```

**AI Generation:**
```
"imagine a futuristic city"        ‚Üí /imagine a futuristic city
"generate music jazz piano"        ‚Üí /music jazz piano
"create video of sunset"           ‚Üí /video sunset
```

**File Operations:**
```
"read the file report.pdf"         ‚Üí /read "report.pdf"
"open the document"                ‚Üí /open
"close file context"               ‚Üí /close
```

### Voice Command Examples
```bash
# Works in voice mode:
You: [speak] "recall our discussion about AI"
OPSIIE: [executes /recall] [speaks results]

You: [speak] "memorize project deadline is Friday"
OPSIIE: [executes /memorize] [confirms]

You: [speak] "show me system status"
OPSIIE: [executes /status] [displays status]

You: [speak] "imagine a cyberpunk cityscape"
OPSIIE: [executes /imagine] [generates image] [confirms]
```

## üé≠ Multi-Agent Voices

### Agent Voice Configuration
Each AI agent has a unique voice configured via ElevenLabs:

```env
# .env configuration
VOICE_ID=your_opsiie_voice_id        # OPSIIE's voice
NYX_VOICE_ID=your_nyx_voice_id       # Nyx's voice
G1_VOICE_ID=your_g1_voice_id         # G1 Black's voice
```

### Agent Voice Usage

**OPSIIE Voice:**
```bash
# Default for all OPSIIE responses
You: Tell me about AI
OPSIIE: [responds in OPSIIE voice]
```

**Nyx Voice:**
```bash
/ask Nyx What are the latest quantum computing developments?
# Nyx responds in Nyx's voice (if voice mode active)
```

**G1 Black Voice:**
```bash
/ask G1 Analyze this technical problem
# G1 responds in G1's voice (if voice mode active)
```

## üìû Live Voice Conversations

### G1 Live Voice
**Real-time voice conversation with G1 Black**

```bash
/ask g1 live
```

**Features:**
- Direct WebSocket connection to ElevenLabs
- Real-time audio streaming
- Continuous conversation
- Press Ctrl+C to end

**How It Works:**
1. Establishes WebSocket connection
2. Starts audio input/output streams
3. You speak, G1 responds immediately
4. Continues until manually stopped

**Example Session:**
```
You: /ask g1 live

[System]: Live conversation with G1 Black initialized.
[System]: Speak naturally. Press Ctrl+C to end the conversation.

You: [speak] What's happening with Bitcoin?
G1 Black: [responds in real-time]

You: [speak] And what about Ethereum?
G1 Black: [responds immediately]

[Press Ctrl+C]
[System]: Ending live conversation...
[System]: Live conversation session concluded.
```

### Kronos Live Voice
**Live conversation with Kronos (Greek Internal Auditor)**

```bash
/ask kronos live
```

Similar to G1 live mode, specialized for Greek internal auditing.

## üîä Voice Synthesis (ElevenLabs)

### Configuration
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key
VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
```

### How It Works
1. Text response generated by OPSIIE
2. Sent to ElevenLabs API
3. Audio synthesized with specified voice
4. Streamed and played back
5. Temporary file cleaned up

### Voice Parameters
- **Optimize Streaming**: Latency=3 (fastest)
- **Format**: MP3
- **Playback**: pygame.mixer
- **Cleanup**: Automatic temp file deletion

### API Verification
OPSIIE verifies ElevenLabs API on startup:
```
Checking Eleven Labs API access... ‚úì
```

## üéß Speech Recognition (Google)

### How It Works
1. Microphone captures audio
2. Google Speech API transcribes
3. Text processed as command/query
4. OPSIIE responds

### Recognition Settings
- **Engine**: Google Speech Recognition
- **Language**: English (default)
- **Timeout**: 20 seconds inactivity
- **Format**: 16-bit PCM

### Microphone Configuration
```python
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
mic = sr.Microphone()
```

### Custom Word Recognition
OPSIIE has enhanced recognition for specific phrases:

**Custom Audio Patterns:**
```python
custom_words = {
    "Opsie": [...],
    "Voice off": [...],
    "send Base Degen": [...],
    # ... custom patterns
}
```

Uses MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) for pattern matching.

## üí° Best Practices

### For Best Recognition

**DO:**
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Use natural language
- Pause between commands
- Minimize background noise
- Position microphone correctly

**DON'T:**
- Speak too fast or mumble
- Use overly technical jargon
- Interrupt OPSIIE mid-response
- Use in very noisy environments

### For Best Experience

**Voice Mode Selection:**
```bash
# For hands-free operation
/voice

# For quiet response consumption
/voice1

# For hands-free input only
/voice2
```

**Timeout Management:**
- Voice mode auto-exits after 20 seconds silence
- Keep conversation flowing
- Say "voice off" to exit manually

**Command Clarity:**
```bash
# Clear commands
"recall project alpha"
"memorize deadline Friday"
"imagine cyberpunk city"

# Avoid ambiguous
"that thing"
"you know what I mean"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Detected
```
Error: No microphone found
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone connection
2. Verify microphone permissions
3. Set default microphone in Windows
4. Restart application

### Voice Synthesis Errors
```
Error with Eleven Labs API
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check API key validity
2. Verify VOICE_ID is correct
3. Check internet connection
4. Verify API usage limits
5. Check API status at elevenlabs.io

### Recognition Issues
```
Could not understand audio
```

**Solutions:**
1. Speak more clearly
2. Reduce background noise
3. Move closer to microphone
4. Adjust microphone gain
5. Check internet connection

### Voice Mode Won't Deactivate
```
Voice mode stuck
```

**Solutions:**
1. Say "voice off" clearly
2. Press Ctrl+C
3. Type /voiceoff in terminal
4. Restart application
