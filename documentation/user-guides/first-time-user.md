## 💡 Best Practices

### Build Your Soul Signature

Your Soul Signature is the highest-priority personalization:

```bash
/soulsig I prefer technical explanations with code examples
/soulsig My favorite color is Lilac
/soulsig I'm working on quantum computing research
/soulsig Don't use my middle name
```

### Use Memory Effectively

**Store:**
- Important facts
- Project details
- Preferences
- Deadlines

**Retrieve:**
- Use specific keywords
- Reference timeframes
- Build knowledge base

### Explore Commands

```bash
/help              # Main menu
/help imagine      # Specific command help
/status            # System status
```

## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ **Not using full paths:**
```bash
Wrong: /read "file.pdf"
Right: /read "C:\Documents\file.pdf"
```

❌ **Vague memory queries:**
```bash
Wrong: /recall stuff
Right: /recall quantum computing discussion
```

❌ **Forgetting to close file context:**
```bash
Always: /close when done with files
```

❌ **Not building Soul Signature:**
```bash
Build it over time with /soulsig
```
